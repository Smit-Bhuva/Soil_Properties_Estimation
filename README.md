## Introduction:
Soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), and nutrient levels (e.g., Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, K, P2O5, S) are crucial for agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.
The use of hyperspectral imaging technology allows for the detailed analysis of soil properties over large areas, providing a non-destructive method to gather data that can enhance soil management practices.
This research focuses on estimating various soil properties using hyperspectral reflectance data, aiming to create accurate maps for better agricultural decision-making in the Anand district.

## Objective:
* Estimate Soil Properties: To utilize hyperspectral imaging to estimate key soil properties, including pH, EC, OC, and essential nutrients, which are vital for crop growth and soil health. 
* Develop Predictive Models: To apply machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) regressors, to develop predictive models that can accurately assess soil characteristics from hyperspectral data. 
* Enhance Agricultural Practices: To provide actionable insights and maps based on the estimated soil properties, facilitating improved agricultural practices and resource management in the studied region.

## Data Variables:
* Independent Variables / Features:
  * HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE WITH 2098 BANDS AND 499 GROUND TRUTH POINTS
